Feminism, women empowerment kar kar ke.
This is the main reason why so much of family issues everywhere.Tired: elizabeth holmes was charming and manipulative. 
Wired: white feminism is a scam and if you just LISTENED to woc then you wouldn't be surprised that women like Holmes exist.So I got this DM from an anti-feminist man. Ovet the course of debate he said that if he ever finds a woman getting raped etc he won't help her because of feminism, as men and women are equal. 
I told him let me know when he gets pregnant.
He blocked meüò£üò£What does feminism look like for men and women in the world today? How does it intersect with class, race, and gender? Even as we partake in conversations about these issues, today's second wave of feminism is nuanced and subtle. So we thought of books... https://t.co/yhMzpwWI5Y@priyankachopra - I love sexting and FaceTime sex.

Feminist women - Yaaiiinnn...Women Empowerment üòé

Any Male Celebrity - I love sexting and FaceTime sex.

Feminist women - Characterless. Pervert. He don‚Äôt know how to respect women. #womenempowerment #feminism #PriyankaChopra@vasudha_ET @fn Hijab and Purdah are both symbols of oppression against women. It's symbolises times when women were traded as (sex-)slaves and used as currencies in the middle-east. No wild imagination can be made to use veil as a symbol for feminism. üòé@ElinHege @sankrant Btw, feminism is one of the shittiest philosophies I‚Äôve ever come across and India doesn‚Äôt need your crap philosophy to protect its women. It‚Äôs when Indians started blindly aping your culture that most problems began. Combined with the western propaganda of making the east civic.We need feminism because leading economists don't seem to understand this basic fact!
Unpaid work and care work that is so disproportionately performed by women as a result of patriarchal control on women's labour, needs to be acknowledged, valued and paid. https://t.co/uBDkRu6rjsIs this called the women empowerment which is being proposed by #feminism ?
Women are women even if it is sister or mother, so this is not the truth. Truth lies in #Equality #SharedParenting #mutual , else kids are sufferer's. Do think #Court #Judges else #NOTA2019 will teach https://t.co/3IynNRlmtwWe need more feminist men in this world, to form a secure enlightened society that will help women to grow and design their own path to success. So to these very special feminist men, a very big thank you.

‚ÄúFeminism isn‚Äôt about making women stronger. Women are already strong. 
It‚Äôs about changing the way the world perceives that strength‚Äù@SatansFury @tweet2el But feminists cannot impose their idea of liberty on Muslim women.. feminism should be about supporting women to be who they are. Give women some benefit of intellect.There are those 'Feminists' who believe every woman they come across should speak and behave the same way as they do or like other women in their lives does. 
It this actually feminism?Also as orgs that are feminist or working on those principles, make your salaries and negotiations more transparent, help prospective employees demand fairer wages. Feminism isn't just about external practices, check your inner workings. 

7/7 #WomenTellAll #womenToday saw a young girl buy a glass of juice for an old lady beggar.

That's feminism for you, friends.

Women helping downtrodden and helpless women is feminism.

"All men are trash" brigade is not feminist. It is the filth of this planet.Feminism is larger than that. 
I agree partially.
'Men are trash' is surely an immature stunt by some woke women here on twitter. 
But then this is Twitter, an empty echo chamber. 
Followers count, retweets, DM's may be their secret aim. https://t.co/RTB7h1LtXdNot at all. Feminism is not about supporting patriarchal traditions. You might have a choice but a lot of Muslim women are forced into it https://t.co/TmCWZZMPpDResearch says that most women show contempt towards successful women. And it has more to do with how they look at themselves than how they feel about other women.

That completely undermines women who choose it for themselves. If your definition of feminism does not include ‚Äúchoice‚Äù, then perhaps a revision of it is required.Dear everyone,
Trans women are women.
Trans men are men.
They are not confused or going through a phase or a threat to society or feminism.
Your aghast well-wisher,
JPThat's why anyone not want argue with women . They relate bad manners to their 2000 years prestige.  üòùüòúüòúüòú Hadd hai , har bat ki ek hi dawai #feminism #Elections2019 https://t.co/2HHDIz6YLnWe need #Feminism Because -

@BDUTT : this is also sexual harassment of the women in @BJP4India. But you won't say anything because probably no one has paid you to speak against it https://t.co/PjEFxAVEim@akshaykMartial @RaghavAbhay @mrsfunnybones And some time this Chetan was talking abt women empowering..... So fake..calling a girl stupid and talking abt feminism.... Fake ideologies@ParijatSingh23 @BDUTT You are absolutely right. I don't see hijab as a symbol of feminism. There are women who consider wearing hijab as their choice, perfectly fine but making that choice equal to feminism is a "grave mistake"For her she is the only women who is the torch bearer of feminism rest all are divisive and anti culture.üôà https://t.co/PLc1ckvAji
