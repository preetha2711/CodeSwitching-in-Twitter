Modi Vs S‚Ä¶@DALIT_power @RifatJawaid @BBCWorld @BBCNews Sure Sir@sandhamarkumar I am not overestimating Admk. If VCK contests in own symbol it ll be projected as a Dalit party getting support from Non SC communities ll be difficult against a caste neutral party like Admk. DMK vote transfer to VCK ll also be difficultRT @republic: #CongViolenceAlliance | Congress is the biggest suppressor of Dalit: Dr. Ajay Alok, Spokesperson JDU https://t.co/Js6z0kR29vRT @KingdomOfFeku: #ModiVsWho
