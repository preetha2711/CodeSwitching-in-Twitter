Every Women Should Wear #HijabExcellent thread on how patraiachy often forces men to "masculine" behaviour that often leads them to unburden their emotional needs on their partners and other women. This tweet tugged my heart.
#feminism #Patriarchy https://t.co/RVPz8SPvOA@FolkishRight @rahuldewan @sankrant Modern feminism has degraded into liberalism with left leanings and anti hindu. Their purpose is only to denigrate Hinduism which always worshipped devi/Maa/Shakti kali with their fake patriarchy,misogynistic rant. The deracinated lutyens' media who peddle these r detstd by publc@VidyaKrishnan Patriarchy is something in our society for centuries. Your hyper-feminism attitute wont help you , small and consistent efforts will do the magic. I know I may sound weird but Im thinking rationally and pratically.@VidyaKrishnan sympathy(not empathy) and give the strength to talk about anything bad happened. but what I hear is that rant. Its simple you want to fight something bad as patriarchy you just cant deal it with something like hyper-feminism. Many not now in this nation maybe in future.Feminism is not a fight against men but a fight against the patriarchal system. Thus , it is important for men to be our allies as well.

https://t.co/mWDUJnYEkx#Patriarchy is so deeply entrenched in our lives, that more often than not we don't even realise that patriarchy is being supported unconsciously.

#Feminism #quotes https://t.co/PlcNffobaMFeminists in the West are absolute clowns. They couldn't show support to women in Iran and Saudi Arabia risking their lives to escape hijab and compulsory male guardianship laws. But wear hijab and endorse Islamic patriarchy themselves for fake solidarity. What feminism is this?They like your style of feminism, when you accept their level of patriarchy. üòä@MasculineDesign @trailblazer2019 Why our society increasingly becoming anti-men? Why its cool to demote men under the flag of #equality and #feminism  The gutsy theme breaking all stereotypes  https://t.co/yGH1Y9XzJD  Do check !My fear with feminism is that it'll make me low key hostile aka unwarranted blames or projecting some of my insecurities on to others. Which is also something that happens because of the patriarchy itself but Imma check myself.I read Carol Gilligan's 'In a Different Voice' in 1982, when it was published. It had a huge impact on me. She's back with a new book which sounds equally powerful. #carolgilligan #patriarchy #feminism https://t.co/OCLFsstYwN@ecfindia @chandana_hiran They need to challenge other men to do the same and educate themselves on the ideology of feminism. This is foremost step to understand sexism and curb it.#MeToo, that started in Hollywood, dragged out many skeletons, but the issues of gender inequality, sexism have been hitting the Tamil film industry in time-lapses.

https://t.co/NP2uZcGG6o@h_tejas @AGirlOfHerWords @seekermridul @FuschiaScribe Well, i fail to see it that way then. Don't think more negativity will change something already negative. It's mutual respect and belief that we are all equal that fuels feminism. To me any amount of sexism that goes against that is an 'adverse consequence'. Peace out.@TheQuartering I've watched the video man, don't try to hide your subtle anti-semitism and sexism in it... its quite obvious dude... not to mention the call back to gamergate and your HATRED of feminism... NAZI!!!!!Got problems with how sexist our language is, or thought you were the only one who believed so? You‚Äôre not alone. @vitaminstree https://t.co/Nz4sHts1ODHow sexist.

Ye aurat Sikhayegi Feminism üôè https://t.co/mtz90qM5TD@AGirlOfHerWords @FuschiaScribe Now, this is irony on different levels. You talk about feminism in a sexist tone. What's the point in even tweeting if you don't believe people are capable of seeing people as people before 'men' or 'women'. You need a crash course on feminism and it's meaning.@firstpost @irfhabib So same actresses has no issues with public applauding sexist remarks and sexist abuses in movies , web series , serials etc ? 
#Mirzapur , #FourMoreShots #VeereDiWedding I mean any more hypocrisy? Let the man rot ...but wat abt these women? #Conditional #FeminismWhen she offends a respected leader like @nitin_gadkari ,she's still Decent, &amp;when u show her the mirror by giving her befitting reply she deserves,u become Sexist,anti womanüòè

@OfficeOfNG @DeepikaBhardwaj @trehan_barkha @Ra_Bies @BJP4Maharashtra @RSSorg @dna https://t.co/9ZyacBdVr4@Dancing_Myrtle @justvoot @aneri_vajani Kunal in this video said "Pari is just like Nandini". I opposed the fact. That's it.
You know, feminism should be kept like feminism and mustn't be made toxic. Everything shouldn't be seen in a sexist way. Had he compared Pari/Mishti with himself, I'd call him out. Ajeeb.Um I couldn't care less about Bollywood drama but how is calling out a person's privilege sexist when it is an essential part of (intersectional) feminism?
Also you do not have to support a woman just because she's a woman. That's tokenism, not feminism. https://t.co/8BUDzjKxRtFeminism equals to gender equality, it is that simple. But there are complex and varying ways you can apply this equation in your life. Writes @yamini_pb

Crime has no gender. No gender can be trusted blindly.
 "ALWAYS TRUST WOMEN " is a deceptive rhetoric of fake feminism and nothing else

It's ok for younger men's to marry older women's.Feminism is being used to create gender divide, a protester demanding a separate commission for men told ThePrint's video journalist @ShahbazAnsar_

https://t.co/C3P2ZRGDgb‚ÄúThis stance does not acknowledge that police are often purveyors of violence and that prisons are always sites of violence.

PSEUDO FEMINISM will further make the confusion more confounded!! üôè@DOCTORATLARGE Feminism has nothingto do with with gender. Moreover being a feminist makes you a real man.What does feminism look like for men and women in the world today? How does it intersect with class, race, and gender? Even as we partake in conversations about these issues, today's second wave of feminism is nuanced and subtle. So we thought of books... https://t.co/yhMzpwWI5YGender studies, and feminism, could, in theory, be very interesting and useful subjects. In reality, its a sh*tstorm of puerile bias, and wish fulfillment. The search for an equal and just society is too important to put in the hands of grievance studies. https://t.co/aQICjDT62k@crossword_book #WeReadWomen

It talks about what feminism is, what it isn't and what it should be
Must read for every1 irrespective of gender https://t.co/Dfa0VwWJwR@jmmcanany @RachelCargle But what is Feminism without equal rights , equal responsibilities for all, and here "all" includes everyone, despite its gender , despite its colour.Reverse the gender &amp; imagine how the news would have been highlighted by mainstream media ‚Å¶@aajtak‚Å© ‚Å¶@ndtv‚Å© ‚Å¶@htTweets‚Å© ‚Å¶@hrw‚Å© ‚Å¶@UNHumanRights‚Å© ‚Å¶@narendramodi‚Å© ‚Å¶@RahulGandhi‚Å© We know your Game of Feminism #NOTA  https://t.co/Y0Wyy0n4QF@itsmeSehrish Ohh feminism I thought leader is a leader irrespective of gender..kuch log kisi leaders ki quality follow karne mein bhi pehle uska gender find out karne lagte hai..The phrase ‚Äúso-called-feminist‚Äù or ‚Äúpseudo feminist‚Äù is redundant. Feminism, as per Oxford‚Äôs definition, is fighting for only one gender‚Äôs rights anyway but under the pretext that it‚Äôs for gender equality. This is like using the phrase ‚Äúblack panther‚Äù.. panthers are black anyway!#MeToo, that started in Hollywood, dragged out many skeletons, but the issues of gender inequality, sexism have been hitting the Tamil film industry in time-lapses.
