I generally don't have much time for people who engage in this type of subject distortion (Black Lives Matter or Dalit Lives Matter with All Lives Matter, or Feminism with Rights for Men and Women).

In this case I made an exception, given her past record.@michaelshermer Did you actually think Euro-Feminism was only about equal rights to operate &amp; compete like a man in regard to "opportunities". Sadly those women  whom sacrificed their womanly sweetness to compete in one "so called" world, this doors swings both ways as the soft man enters yours.Once upon a time feminism was for women's freedom, liberation, rights. Today it is about defending hijab, burqa, niqab and child marriage, forced conversion, forced marriage as long as Islamists are doing it@FridaKahlo was a Mexican artist whose striking, distinctive works combine an exploration of gender, class, &amp; identity with symbols from the nation‚Äôs cultural history.

It filed off all the edges, and turned this cultural treatise on political female rage into a relatively insular expression of relationship frustration.The female characters,in particular, are well defined. They are not women from Venus &amp; Mars who are in privileged positions, preaching what feminism is. Instead,they are women we meet every day, bound by society's definition of what is right and what is wrong -@behindwoods #Airaa#ShameOnYouShalini
