Shame on you and shame on @ImaanZHazir  too.The phrase “so-called-feminist” or “pseudo feminist” is redundant. Feminism, as per Oxford’s definition, is fighting for only one gender’s rights anyway but under the pretext that it’s for gender equality. This is like using the phrase “black panther”.. panthers are black anyway!Here's a very interesting observation. While my DP and posts about workout and kids get a lot of love from my FB friends, posts on Feminism are largely ignored by the majority. 
Peeps, talking about equality isn't radical; it is humane. Think about it!Feminism equals to gender equality, it is that simple. But there are complex and varying ways you can apply this equation in your life. Writes @yamini_pb
https://t.co/FSDsfb7gahbitches quick to scream equality this and feminism that but sure the fuck love double standards hahaIt saddens &amp; angers me when women or men talk about needing permission/asking for permission from their husbands/fathers.

This from women in an upscale B'lore community. #feminism@YehAccntFakeHai God no!!

Don't bring out feminism to justify Nandini please. She is a woman. I agree. She gets the privilege of hurting others and get away with being a woman and her fans talking feminism. No.Um I couldn't care less about Bollywood drama but how is calling out a person's privilege sexist when it is an essential part of (intersectional) feminism?
