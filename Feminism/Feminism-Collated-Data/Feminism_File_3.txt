"Yaar uss hot teacher ne molest kiya? Molestation kya be, tune... https://t.co/DramW7EYOnI have often been described a 'feminist' but how 'they' interpret it is completely different from what I believe in. I fight for equality with men in the field in education, salary, dress, safety, domestic work, sexuality. Lets grow together on our abilities. #feminism #peaceRelying on state violence to curb domestic violence only ends up harming the most marginalized women.

Feminism is hypocrisy and misandry https://t.co/ADjW8iujJT#FridayThoughts  Revolutionary concepts such as #MeToo and #Feminism are often Hijacked and corrupted by the already Privileged. The ones who wanna ride on Rising wave of Support and Brownie points.@LilyDPenha It was not at all sincere Lily. This is a brand of elite feminism which does very little for the women who really need it, although glad that #MeToo blew up. I see women with jute bags practicing better feminism than these online feminists.#Metoo #ThursdayThoughts #AG3daagse #AFLTigersPies #BaseballIn4Words #Brexit #murderofmerit #OlesAtTheWheel #CPIMManifesto #JanManNiranjan #Metooindia #indicativevotes #MumbaiIndiansKaFan  #GGMU  #Trump #love #ThursdayMotivation
