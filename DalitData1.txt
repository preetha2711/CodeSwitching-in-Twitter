https://t.co/pF86TFYlXx@shrikanth_krish Most people take up teaching as their profession, when they can‚Äôt get into creamy layer jobs. Earlier it was the less pay which made many bright minds shun teaching jobs. In due course, reservation seeped deep &amp; has played spoilsport in degrading the merits.This psychopath who deprived poors of Delhi with health benefits of 5 Lac under Ayushman Bharat &amp; 10% reservation for non creamy layer earning &lt; 8 Lac; just because Modi launched it, should get same number of seats which he got in last Lok Sabha Elections

#Reservation #Chowkidars@RiteshKopite Never understood this Brahmin hating ideology. We work hard and climb the  ladder get,neither we asked for reservations nor we want it. Just give reservation to the poor Brahmins who can't afford education.

For thousands of years brahmins are taking reservation in temples.

You first speak on brahmin reservation then you discuss on bahujan reservation.RT @MyselfViraj: @RakshaMishra11 Your religion doesn't allow any other person than brahmin to to perform puja, hom-havan etc and take the b‚Ä¶@rupasubramanya @TarekFatah Applause miss RUPA .
then in the same way why caste wise reservation should be there?because our ancestors brahmin did wrong to them.
We are not doing the same .
Hypocracy at its purest form.#idiotrupa@mani1972ias Legally done? Where? What has actually been done is strip away whatever little opportunity the Dalit-Bahujan-Adivasi could access through reservation using laws like 10% reservation to the Brahmin-Savarna "poor". 
https://t.co/cUA4CnT2ah@mani1972ias We don't need reservation.
Just strip the Brahmin-Savarna of all the inherited privileges and wealth accumulated over centuries of oppression of the Dalit-Bahujan-Adivasis.
https://t.co/KF0BdAPVfugood bro support this age relaxation should be min of 3 years and in present scenario there should not be any reservation on caste because today we see a brahmin marring a sc.
There should be only one reservation for all i.e only for poor #EWS
Remove all fucking reservations https://t.co/P1FPBoOemI@mani1972ias How many of them are willing to give up their caste names, their customs which signifies them as "Brahmins" (Brahmin is an identity of caste supremacy), and their inherited accumulated wealth and privileges? How many supports reservation? Any data?

Think it over.@cbhanp Important to distinguish upper OBCs from lower OBCs. Lower OBCs are small in numbers and alot like semi-Dalit. With lion share of OBC reservation going to upper OBCs,lower OBC left with unnoticed struggle of social mobilitydalit and demands caste based reservation. Now lower upper caste also wants the reservation.

Term limit on PM role .. [willing to consider 15 years instead of 10 years MAX .. or 3 full terms] https://t.co/nIYS3L5tVeThe reservation for women in legislatures will be anti democratic but reservation for women by political parties in fielding candidates will be appropriate for a healthy democracy.

ASHAMEDThe Fact of the matter is Slum Dwellers are getting more facilities than the Taxpayers cause they are the Vote Banks of the Politicians. A Brilliant Officer is made to work under a Duffer just cause of Reservation. Is this called Democracy.#DemocracyLive #YeMeraIndia @TimesNowReservation is not an issue of bread, it is a matter of participation in governance administration in the country.If there is no equal share of people in the public, then democracy does not run correctly.The country does not grow further, it goes backward.
    
  #Kanshiram_Sahab https://t.co/m9O6cfzKAt@mybloggs22 democracy is in danger when any powerful institution is cornered by few people with same ideology or in our case same caste. So it is very important to diversify thinkers in it. At current scenario I believe nationalism of media and reservation is good idea #BoycottGodiMediaIs giving reservation to women a solution?
Won't that affect the freedom of citizen to elect a leader of their choice?
Is reservation a right move in democracy?
