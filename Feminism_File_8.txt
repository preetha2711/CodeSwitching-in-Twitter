It is in the nature of equality that any attempt by a gender to push for a gender-biased privilege leads to their self-objectification. For example, back in the times of war, it was staying back in the comfort of their homes. Today’s example: free entries or drinks at pubs.

3/ Misogyny starts at homes, when mothers take pride in not letting their sons do anything.
Sons force mothers to toil for them even if they are tired from the day’s work.

@MehboobaMufti Shame on you, you being a women support such rapist. This rapist also framed the whole fake narrative of rape charges against dogras. Also collected funds for rape victim, which he never gave to the victims family.

@visualfumble @AGirlOfHerWords (2)...But putting a blanket statement like men are trash for the actions of a certain few is plain wrong. And if isn't, then we should also start saying women are trash, scum, perpetual liars, deeply evil etc. for the ones who lie about rape, abuse their children etc.
