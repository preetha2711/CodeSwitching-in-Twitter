It is in the nature of equality that any attempt by a gender to push for a gender-biased privilege leads to their self-objectification. For example, back in the times of war, it was staying back in the comfort of their homes. Today’s example: free entries or drinks at pubs.

3/ Misogyny starts at homes, when mothers take pride in not letting their sons do anything.
Sons force mothers to toil for them even if they are tired from the day’s work.

@MehboobaMufti Shame on you, you being a women support such rapist. This rapist also framed the whole fake narrative of rape charges against dogras. Also collected funds for rape victim, which he never gave to the victims family.

@JeevesReginald @binny1905 The point I was originally making was a counter argument to sulabh's point. The point is that it's not difficult for women to go and lodge complains of domestic abuse or rape. https://t.co/ns0Xw6iBys
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@binny1905 @JeevesReginald @deepsealioness You think that doesn't happen to men as well!? It happens in both cases.

And no! It's not very hard to file a case of domestic abuse at all. And not is it very hard to file a case of rape. Just the fact that rape laws are being misused to threaten people is proof enough of that.
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@sridhargppm @deepsealioness Yup!! That's the only way you can prove marital rape! Heck, even then it's not prosecuted as marital rape. It's prosecuted as domestic abuse and it is definitely grounds for divorce.

तुषारा नाम की 27 वर्षीय युवती को भूख से तड़पा-तड़पा कर मार दिया। 

जिस समय युवती की मौत हुई, उसका वजन केवल 20 किलो था।

पुलिस की मानें तो महिला का शरीर कंकाल जैसा दिखने लगा था, जिसमें मुश्किल से ही मांस बचा था।

केरल के कोल्लम में तुषारा नाम की एक 27 वर्षीय युवती को दहेज के कारण भूख से तड़पा-तड़पा कर मार दिया गया। इस मामले में रोंगटे खड़े कर देने वाली बात यह है कि जिस समय युवती की मौत हुई, उस वक्त उसका वजन केवल 20 किलो था।

#shunlinkedinad  
Ad by https://t.co/XNLQ9xwX3X shown on TV(you can see during IPL matches now)in India is highlighting importance of a son's education.
Why not show a daughter or both in the ad?Feel there is natural bias and it's not supporting women especially now.
