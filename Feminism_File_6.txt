@AndWithNoCheese @Lesdoggg I agree, men get sexually assaulted, raped, abused, be in a toxic relationship. Anyone can. Terry Crews, Johhny Depp are good examples. But the numbers don't lie in that comparatively these cases occur much less than female cases do, even more so now that the culture is changing

@Syaandai @vmwagh @NBYousafzai @newagesong Sati was a voluntary practise which got corrupted so we got rid of it. Jauhar was a result of the Islamic pogroms, women chose death over life as captives and sold and used till they die.

@rahil_khan @Rona36 @J2YKanodia @madhukishwar @Swamy39 Dear man,  sati started only because of your forbears... when the marauding barbaric Mughals came,  Hindu women chose to jump into the funeral pyres of their husbands rather than be carried off into slavery... that's the real, unvarnished truth.

So, by your own account, we Hindus are told sati (jauhar) or self- immolation is symbol of purity. Women are brain washed, made to drink intoxicants and 'burnt Alice's on the pure of husbands!

@ButImCold @in_my_sanctuary @BeingChatterjee Which era are you talking about? And Sati wasn't a Hindu practice. Hindus all over India didn't practice it. Check your facts. And as for prostitution, really? Every religion and caste is represented. Women in Islam get the worst treatment among all religions
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@trifaleyheramb @Shehzad_Ind Hindu rules too kept fighting for territory and thrown all the time. But it could have been less violent due to moral compass of the time and also information is distorted because of age.

Proper emphasis was never given to curse Sati practice in school books

@Bharti58363241 @Bharti58363241 have u ever read hindu scriptures mam . I am an ex muslim but i have read hindu scriptures. Devdasi and sati system were not in vedas moreover they were practiced in very small parts of india . But things maulanas do like mutah , halala is in accordance with quran

@mani1972ias @SanobarFatma Trust me, discussions will be of use only if they are two way. Blindly sticking to dogmas won‚Äôt help any religious community. The Hindu community has had the courage to challenge ‚Äòcustoms‚Äô like sati/ Widow remarriages/ untouchability etc because the followers were ready to change

@TimesNow Raja Ram Mohan Roy, one of the biggest Hindu reformer, had studied in a Madrasa. He fought against the social evils of Hindu society like Sati pratha and Child marriage. He was a scholar of Arabic and Persian, and the title Raja was given to him by the Mughal Emperor.
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@anindita_guha @Musanghism Yes. And he looked deep into the vedic philosophy to form his criticism of idolatry, sati and all other repressive hindu customs that were prevalent in his time. He found them to be a corruption of the ancient philosophy and scriptures.
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@Musanghism He was well versed in Sanskrit and wanted a synthesis of Vedantic and Western philosophy. His fight against the prevalent Hindu customs was rooted in his understanding of the Vedas. His argument against Sati were based on the Shastras.

@thaminafaiz @JohnHod28176889 @PolicingInsight @DrEllaC Find me one case of sati before muslim invasions and I'll believe it.. well you can't.
Sati just means pious woman. 
No sati in any Hindu myth burns herself, not a single one. They all live, long after.
Do a search for jauhar ( another name for sati ) to find the truth.
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@rahil_khan @Rona36 @J2YKanodia @madhukishwar @Swamy39 Dear man,  sati started only because of your forbears... when the marauding barbaric Mughals came,  Hindu women chose to jump into the funeral pyres of their husbands rather than be carried off into slavery... that's the real, unvarnished truth.
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@Shazia @pawanjotkaur_ From 1-4 , Hindu women had to choose this because Muslims converted, kidnapped and raped Hindu ladies. Sati pratha was also because of this. And for your last three points , we can‚Äôt fall at your level of being so cheap!
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@awweej @MauveMemory Well, You're one of the few who Had a choice of Hizab, and you chose what you felt right.

Elsewhere Hizab is forced and women in Iran are tortured for denying to wear it.

If Hindu Woman wants 'Sati' on her own will, does it become progressive? No, it's regressive! so is Hizab.
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
Oh, my Hindu scholars, it's clear you are biased despite your erudition! A society determines its own rules, customs &amp; ways of life. We, Hindu society, had approved Sati, bigamy, atrocities on women and poor in the name of caste, slavery, bonded labour. Are these acceptable now! https://t.co/gqZdZDDL3p
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@Syaandai @vmwagh @NBYousafzai @newagesong Sati was a voluntary practise which got corrupted so we got rid of it. Jauhar was a result of the Islamic pogroms, women chose death over life as captives and sold and used till they die. 
Even Christians have got rid of their bad practices. Can u say the same for Islam?
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!

@ParvaizAhmadMi1 @mkatju Sati was abolished 150 years ago
But women in Islam are still suffering from Nikal Halala
And 
What is your view about ISIS
They considers themselves more muslim than you
They may behead you also if you do not believe their claim?
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@Sarmadi_A @mkatju @HamidMirPAK @beenasarwar @Razarumi @iamthedrifter Look at the bigotry!!

Can anyone find a worse in Hinduism where Sati is prescribed by God? Sati has no scriptural basis. But Killing Apostates, Homosexuals, Adulterers does in Islam.

@rajsubhasish @dimaagkadahi_ @VashiMant @tweet2el Islam preaching does not promote HALALA like Sati was practised in India but HALALA is not allowed in Islam in any country or period!!
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@Kan_chan101 @SanataniGaurav Islam totally needs reforms, like we also banned sati pratha and all tho it was just in some cultures and areas of india, developed after invasion, but it's not practiced now, scholars need to sit and have atleast a debate for fuck sake, people use islam for worng doings.

Aren‚Äôt child rights more important than backward traditions?

Then why have we discontinued dowry, Sati &amp; child marriages ?

Let‚Äôs take India back to the dark ages !

No, instead they're supposed to wear duppatta, ghoonghat, mangalsutra, saree, ghagra etc

Don't face triple talaq, but their husband abandon them.

Didn't face "halala", but used to face sati, jauhar, &amp; now are secluded when on periods, pati k joothe bartan mai khao, etc üëèüëèüëè https://t.co/hOdkpYSKJk

@sagarikaghose What a shame! Will you approve of Sati/Child marriage if done voluntarily? If hijab/ghoonghat is not oppressive, could you please enlighten us if its fashion choice?
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@NOBODYis_PRFECT @MauveMemory Also I don‚Äôt see how you can compare the backwardness of a practice like Sati with Hijab. 
Hijab is just me covering my body it isn‚Äôt killing anybody.

@irenaakbar Hijab shows an oppressive attitude of Muslim men. Just like sati pratha or parda. You are not even allowed to enter any mosque. Be selfish care for yourself before your tradition.

@CutawayGuy He was a king though, different religions can have same practices. For kings it was a matter of pride that how many women did committed Sati. It was like a competition between different raj-gharanas.
