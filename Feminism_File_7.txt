It would definitely be similar for a boy. It really depends on the type of predator and crime. Mental abuse is usually not restricted to a specific gender. Sexual abuse can also occur among both boys and girls, but is more often observed among women and girls.

@kappansky @svaradarajan @narendramodi oh really? is it happening only in gujarat and only in Hindu religion? wow. Fantastic GK u have. 
a religion where if father in law rapes his daughter in law, the personal law asks the girl to consider him as her husband. and much much more. 
now you will teach us to be tolerant.

Perks of being an Indian girl.

You get to compromise a lot.
Walk keeping your head down.
Your opinion doesn't matter.
You don't get to choose at all.
Elders are always right.
Cooking is all you need to learn.
Your feelings are just tantrums.
Education is a tool to get a husband.

@monokoos Yes, I get the historical accuracy thing, but it still is too much for me. It's just that I'd to see women being powerful and amazing without having to be abused to be so. I will watch GoT but it's nice that there is an alternative show with all the fun and minus the sexism.

Because NASA forgot that women are shaped differently and didn't budget properly, they're going to cancel it. This is sexism, both institutionalized (no budget for new suits) and internalized (figured women could make men's spacesuits work, or forgot women have different needs)

a false statistic is used for political agendas.If I hated women or was a sexist man I wouldn't be friends with wrestlers.I wouldn't support them I would keep putting them down because of their gender  that what a real sexist person is.And they are minority just like some have.

Comment by a Maha Congress leader on Smriti Irani (size of her bindi denotes more husbands) is the most communal, sexist &amp; misogynist comment of this campaign.  It insults not only her but also all Hindu women who wear a bindi.

But liberals are silent  #LokSabhaElections2019
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
"They experience the sexist narrative forced upon the female sex."

So they experience sexism because they are read as, and treated as, women/females.

If one is read as female, one is at risk of gender-based oppression. Sexism doesn't care about "sex".
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
The remark by this low standard @INCIndia leader is not just sexist,but against the very culture that hindu women follow. Tharoor, Kawade, Sidharamiah and their likes always has something to put mud on hinduistic symbols. Never do they dare to have a peep at other religions.

@MasterZelox The issue is that if you can levy a case for a right being ‚Äúsexist‚Äù it stops being a right and becomes a privilege. Don‚Äôt conflate the two.

Women‚Äôs rights have been laughed at since the suffragettes first took to the streets. At every step women‚Äôs rights advocates are ridiculed.

Gender-pay-gap is real.
If you don‚Äôt think so, ask the men in your life how much they make and then ask their women counterparts the same question, and you‚Äôll see.

@swetasheth1 Men and women need not vote for Tejasvi for far right ideology he pedals and consequences thereof. However @LavanyaBallal is wrong in saying being against reservation is misogyny. She is free to pedal her narrative too. We are a free country :)

@guy_rational He doesn't condemn kafir mentality, conversion mentality, muslim supremacy mentality, Arab mentality, misogyny in Islam, bad practices of Islam, caste system being used amongst Christians and Muslims.

@t_d_h_nair They will NEVER stop. Misogyny is part of their ideology.That‚Äôs why I wonder at the dishonesty of women Bjp members,as well as supporters, who have bought into this rank sexism.

@deepsealioness No one justifying any violence against women by anyone,  but a law on this marital rape is not possible.. Wife and husband have sex, if suddenly she goes to cops and says yesterday's sex was marital rape,  what is the way for a husband to prove his innocence?
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@CChristineFair Mam my point was that ,Indian system has everything which can ensure every possible freedom, it's the people including  we men ,we brahmins to be specific, who are not living upto it .Also some criminal ,because not everyone molest women in buses or rape them, atleast I have not.

The glass-ceiling is not only in pay but in the nature of jobs offered to women too. Low-skilled and low-paying jobs begin a chain that further disempowers them. Skill, education, opportunity &amp; pay parity need to align for our women to be empowered.
