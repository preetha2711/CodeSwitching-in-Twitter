It would definitely be similar for a boy. It really depends on the type of predator and crime. Mental abuse is usually not restricted to a specific gender. Sexual abuse can also occur among both boys and girls, but is more often observed among women and girls.

@kappansky @svaradarajan @narendramodi oh really? is it happening only in gujarat and only in Hindu religion? wow. Fantastic GK u have. 
a religion where if father in law rapes his daughter in law, the personal law asks the girl to consider him as her husband. and much much more. 
now you will teach us to be tolerant.

Perks of being an Indian girl.

You get to compromise a lot.
Walk keeping your head down.
Your opinion doesn't matter.
You don't get to choose at all.
Elders are always right.
Cooking is all you need to learn.
Your feelings are just tantrums.
Education is a tool to get a husband.

@dr_singh1806 @VeengasJ So coming back on the point that you have never ever expressed your concern for any girl in the world till now, Lets come to your secular hindu definition, i mean what is it that hurts so badly to you when i say Hindu Girl?
!!!!$$$EOT$$$!!!!
@dr_singh1806 @VeengasJ Now secondly, in Pakistan it has happening since a long time with Hindus, not with Musalmaan, so what was the reason which hurted this communal to say Hindu word with an abducted girl? I think Hindu is a subset of your ‚Äògeneric‚Äô girl definition? Then why not to be specific
