As a Brahmin from your Clan its a no-brainer to vote for @INCIndia, whose policies have always helped the meritocracy ; but Rahul G compels us to vote otherwise#BrahminINCvsBaniyaBJP
Brahmin has been traditional vote bank of Congress but BJP and other regional parties have made a vent in this vote bank. Brahmin want to revive the stature that they held in Congress. Time to Revive that Strature.

The progress is slow, but is happening. Personally I also feel it takes time for us to understand the impact and complexity of these rituals. It is not just about privilege.Lauding of the brahmin identity DOES NOT GO AWAY no matter the gender identity. How people decide that intersectionality is unimportant is ridiculous and a product of privilege and nothing less.@mani1972ias @yadwas Do I need to "stereotype" oppressors? People don't have control over their birth. But they do have control over how they choose to live. Brahmins who have relinquished all privilege is no longer a Brahmin. So, how am I stereotyping?
https://t.co/PtuZ5X5GL7@mani1972ias @NilimDutta There is no way a Brahmin can give up Brahminism - even if she wants it. The best way is to acknowledge her privilege, stop appropriating Bahujan voices, vacate positions of power which rightfully belongs to them.  The only Brahmin who did this was in 12th C- his name is Basava.@mani1972ias Brahmin identity means only one thing: CASTE OPPRESSOR.
And you have no right to tell us what we should think/say about Brahmins.
And please don't try to teach us how we should fight against Brahmins, Brahminism, and caste oppression. Not your privilege.
https://t.co/ehj7YuyZpS@mani1972ias (1) What is there to "stereotype"?
"Brahmin" is an identity of caste supremacy.
It also is an identity deeply entrenched in caste &amp; class privilege.
If someone doesn't want to be identified as such, should relinquish all that identifies him/her as Brahmin.
https://t.co/Cu0x4jYr9G@mani1972ias @NilimDutta @surajyengde Mani Sir, until unless they accept their privilege, they are casteist. Period.
