#AntiNationalBJP@IndiaToday @Swamy39 we Indians appreciate your honesty. You said that you lacking something to become a Chowkidar as you are a Brahmin. There is no caste, colour, religion or race to be a Chowkidar. Don’t be upset about this. Cheer up.Our great Religion of Hinduism has NOT given any caste concepts. They are the creations of perverse minds. Nor has Hinduism made any VARNA supreme over the other. Brahmin is not given the right or monopoly on knowledge &amp; supreme occupations.

Caste certificate from Gram Pan…@itispalkova Govt Of India is Secular HEHE that's the Biggest joke I have ever heard in my life. Upper Caste's ill treat their own SC/ST/OBC Hindus are talking about secularism.@itispalkova Do you mean Hindutva Upper Caste Terrorists should stick to their age old tradition of harassing SC/ST/OBC communities.@Red_Pastures Same doubt... @NeoDravidian 
Also... DMK hasn't asked for rollback of 10% upper caste quota, despite opposing it. So atleast they should've demanded increase in SC, ST, OBC quota no??
Other UPA allies like RJD would support them !RT @nehalaktr: Shameless @NitishKumar .

Do you discriminate on caste as you have @verified even pigs of Brahmins but not great Dalits.To destroy this powerful structure, education is the key weapon.

There was a reason why ambedkar burnt the manusmriti in protest because it was creator of this caste systemAccording to Ambedkar, caste system represents a graded system of inequality, with castes arranged in an ascending scale of reverence and a descending scale of contempt (Chakravarti, 2003) #JaiBhim #Ambedkar #Anticastepolitics #annihilationofCaste #indiapol@Anitutionalized The problem is the Indian cultural idea of respecting "elders." Old men who legitimise patriarchy, sexual exploitation, caste &amp; shitty religious customs. Among many of them were the marauders of Partition, 1984 &amp; 2002.

And morons who say 'lower caste' converted to Islam bcoz of oppression, have a look at reality, just like today they are resisting, it was always the 'lower castes' that fought for Dharma against invaders. https://t.co/ZXItyIqAWpMedia :

Caste System is bad. 

Upper Castes should not oppress Lower Castes. 

Lower Castes have been exploited for centuries by Upper Castes. 

We should stop caste discrimination.

Politics should be done above caste.

Also Media : https://t.co/Qx1iLNMdNz@YRDeshmukh The only Hindus in Pakistan are from the so called lower castes. Each upper caste person has already converted minimum of two generations ago.

Also... DMK hasn't asked for rollback of 10% upper caste quota, despite opposing it. So atleast they should've demanded increase in SC, ST, OBC quota no??
Other UPA allies like RJD would support them !@AbbakkaHypatia @Shankroxx @aniketdorwat @Shudraism @h_tejas The reservation system has been manipulated and exploited heavily.

Every so often, you can see some comminuy demanding OBC status or something, regardless of their actual standing in the caste hierarchy. :/@SNC18192026 If they can't put baranwal in Obc,they should declare that Baranwal was is in general category. But the point is that no one knows at the Central level that 'baranwal' is also a caste . We r neither in Obc category nor in general. My point is why we r not in any of the category.@patel_rudrank @TheJanbaazKhan @Anjupra7743 Rohit sardana jatt

Brahmins are the root cause of evils in Indian society

But there are some flaws…@anveshpethiya @INCMP @OfficeOfKNath But road to appease certain caste and community is easy for them.. they increased reservation for obc's just before election.. I guess employment and development is secondary for them..@PMOIndia sir my name is prachi and I want the recognition of my caste-baranwal at the Central level.there is no any reservation for us. Na to hm general category me aate h na he Obc me..#ChowkidarNarendraModi https://t.co/qjAgw9w4v8@narendramodi Hello sir🙏🙏...  Mera name prachi h.. or Mai "caste-baranwal"se belong Karti hu... And there is no any recognition of our caste at Central level.. no one know that .. which caste is Baranwal.. Sir, I have send the mail regarding this to Obc ministry to Bihar and Indian govt. https://t.co/DRRKXisx1X@atheist_delhi @ShivAroor @GauravPandhi Ravish, Sagarika, etc are all mostly Upper Caste!

Please don't tell them they support that OBC Modi.  :-PRSS/ BJP has divided India in to partition days like communal&amp; caste divisions to pursue unfulfilled dream of Hindurastra to snatch constitutional rights of reservation of SC/ST/OBC and Minorities. Forgetting almost all Indian Muslims and Christians are original inhabitants. https://t.co/j7dLLAiCnD@shahid_siddiqui It is a natural human phenomena. Universal. Even animals &amp; plants do it. India not exception. Before, Brahmins used to hide caste, wanna be actors caled themselvs kapoor, taporis say "i am khan/mohammad/etc", pakis abrod say they are Indians, SC/ST/OBC may hide caste if nid be.@MyVadodara Vadodara is one of few constituency where caste factor is least effective. Hence chances are bright for the talented politicians from other castes who are not into brackets like Patel, Koli, OBC etc. Let good candidate be chosen.#India remains a deeply conservative society:unable to unshakel from caste /gender /religion divisions. 

#BJP couldn't hold on to its OBC president, someone got rid of him through a scandal. That's the rub, even parties with different politics fail at these divisions.

Whichever party you support, make sure that your vote is decided by how it performed, responded to tragedies etc. and not by freebies. Desist such attempts!

However it's not even a decade old data which would make extraordinary changes in it.
The people u talk about are only about 10-15% in SC/ST 1/2It reads as " to which caste of SC/ST group you belong to"
