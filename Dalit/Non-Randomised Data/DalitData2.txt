Even 10% ews reservation should also be struck down on this premise. Efficiency/ meritocracy can't be a casualty of political expediency. https://t.co/BsNyXcglY3India elected you,Mr. #Modi in 2014 because we saw someone who would rise above petty caste based politics, we were hoping that you’d promote meritocracy; instead you choose to make 2019 a Hindu Vs Muslim contest &amp; burdened reservation with another 10%. We’re disappointed in you!@IamManish9700 @pbhushan1 @savebsnlindia @savithaaram Survival of the fittest. Mediocrity crept into BSNL, perhaps because of reservation sans meritocracy. Now BSNL will die a natural death like Air India. It's a hard economic world out there, in this millenium. Slacking time ended with 2014.Ironic. Let's add 50% caste reservation. 10% class reservation. 10% state reservation. 10% management quota. Finally 20% from your favourite vote-bank.
