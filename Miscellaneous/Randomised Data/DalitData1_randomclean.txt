RT @monteskw: Dalits especially on Twitter get agitated at the mention of creamy layer. The whole idea of reservation is representation @Red_Pastures: - Caste-based 
- Reservation in 
- Abolish Creamy Layer for

@srinipadmanaban Really? Reservation in private sector, abolition of creamy layer, most backward classes classification, Ram sethu project, releasing the SECC data, law for rehabilitation of Widows, 'Periyar-Phule joint housing scheme' - which of these do you expect to see in congress 

@cheyyaruarun @NicheBrain Yes yes. Of course. Did you read the full manifesto? It includes abolition of National emergency provision, reservation in judiciary, abolition of creamy layer - none of which is actually possible. But should DMK not voice for it? 

That is what they've promised.Was Ambedkar wrong and short-sighted in recommending reservation for 10 years?  Why SC insisted on Creamy Layer Principle for OBCs?

Earlier it was the less pay which made many bright minds shun teaching jobs. In due course, reservation seeped deep &amp; has played spoilsport in degrading the merits.This psychopath who deprived poors of Delhi with health benefits of 5 Lac under Ayushman Bharat &amp; 10% reservation for non creamy layer earning &lt; 8 Lac; just because Modi launched it, should get same number of seats which he got in last Lok Sabha
