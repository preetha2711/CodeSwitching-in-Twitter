# CodeSwitching-in-Twitter

Observe the sentences:
1. 	Vah chair par khadi ho gai
2. 	Yeh mera personal maamla hai.
and
3. 	Maine apni behen ko phone kiya.
All three instantiate code-mixing on a lexical level. There is a difference, however, in the fact that one might reasonably hear
1’. Vah kursi par khadi ho gai
whereas, as someone recently remarked to me, it is much more anomalous for a modern Hindi speaker to say
2’. Yeh mera vyaktigat maamla hai
and it is difficult to render (3) naturally in Hindi at all; (3) might not, in fact, even be considered code-mixing.  
One explanation for this is that the discourse of privacy and the personal has been culturally borrowed from a Western ideology. It is not, of course, an imported technology, as in (3); Hindi might well contain the vocabulary to support it, but using the original English code ‘personal’ might remain the preferred way of expressing a concept that was introduced from outside the cultural currency of Hindi. If in a corpus, therefore, we segregate discussions of furniture, privacy, and communication from each other, and found that
1. The communication category contained a larger percentage of CS than the furniture category,
2. The privacy category contained a larger percentage of CS than the furniture category,
we could provide a sociolinguistic explanation for each, and one explanation might differ from the other.
This, in short, is the motivation to analyse the code-mixing in discourses with different local semantic properties, both standalone per category, and against each other.
