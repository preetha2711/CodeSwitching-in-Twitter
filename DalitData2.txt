However it didn't happened, instead reservation was used as a tool by politicians to churn vote out of it.Was Ambedkar wrong and short-sighted in recommending reservation for 10 years?

Is this called Democracy.#DemocracyLive #YeMeraIndia @TimesNowReservation is not an issue of bread, it is a matter of participation in governance administration in the country.If there is no equal share of people in the public, then democracy does not run correctly.The country does not grow further, it goes backward.

Even 10% ews reservation should also be struck down on this premise. Efficiency/ meritocracy can't be a casualty of political expediency. https://t.co/BsNyXcglY3India elected you,Mr. #Modi in 2014 because we saw someone who would rise above petty caste based politics, we were hoping that you‚Äôd promote meritocracy; instead you choose to make 2019 a Hindu Vs Muslim contest &amp; burdened reservation with another 10%. We‚Äôre disappointed in you!@IamManish9700 @pbhushan1 @savebsnlindia @savithaaram Survival of the fittest. Mediocrity crept into BSNL, perhaps because of reservation sans meritocracy. Now BSNL will die a natural death like Air India. It's a hard economic world out there, in this millenium. Slacking time ended with 2014.Ironic. Let's add 50% caste reservation. 10% class reservation. 10% state reservation. 10% management quota. Finally 20% from your favourite vote-bank.
